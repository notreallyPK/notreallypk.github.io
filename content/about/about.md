Hi, I'm **Pratik Kokil**, a Mechanical Design Engineer, passionate about Automobiles, EV's, Stand-up comedy, Motorcycle riding, Travel and all things under the sky (also, Space!). 

This is my corner on the internet. Corner where I store good content, interesting reads and awesome things which I can consume from time and again. 

like a notes app but on the internet. 

Here's my [LinkedIN](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pratik-kokil-60266915a/) and [Twitter](https://x.com/notreallyPK) (yep, I'm still gonna call it that!)
