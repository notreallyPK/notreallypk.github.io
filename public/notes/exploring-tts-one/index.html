    <p>An exploration into different models available in Text to Speech (and perhaps writing some frontend for it)</p>
    <p>With the shut-down of services like Pocket and Google Assistant&rsquo;s &ldquo;Read-it-to-me&rdquo; feature, I feel that there is no longer an easy way to store / read webpages on android, with similar quality.[^1]</p>
<p>Now, of course there are alternatives, but I just find them to be quite irritating. Speechify is one of them, but I don&rsquo;t like the spammy ad&rsquo;s and limitations, with endless amount of extra options on voices / modes etc. Not to mention - you&rsquo;ve got to shell out a decent amount of money.[^2]</p>
<p>This gave me the perfect excuse to look at Text-To-Speech models. Specifically, open source models, how good have they become, and can they help me consume content via audio - better than existing products ?</p>
<p>I did a basic search for small models, I was looking to work with something locally. I had an NVIDIA-RTx 3060 with 4 GB memory usage.[^3] OuteTTS looked good - it had a bunch of models, the largest one being 1B.</p>
<p>I got to work, quickly set it up, selected a few works that I had stored in Pocket - and ran it across. The first time, I didn&rsquo;t explicitly set a CUDA device, it went to CPU, and it took ~3 hrs to actually get an audio sample (a .wav file).</p>
<p>With CUDA setup - it still takes about 1 hr. I initially faced out of memory issues. (A small hack at DAC - interface.py).</p>
<p>Now this was an issue, such a long time to create a 5 min talk. But perhaps this was due to large models, I continue with testing on smaller models.</p>
<p>Along the way, I also stumbled acorss an interesting concept called DAC (Descript Audio Codec // paper: High Fidelity Compression with Improved RVQGAN).</p>
<p>So I had to understand - How does this model work on an android phone, can I run it way faster, and another stuff, can I make it sound differently.</p>
<p>The last step is because, lot&rsquo;s of models only have a default model that works really well, but the model with outetts literally breathes a lot, during pauses. In order to make it more &ldquo;natural&rdquo;. Which degrades the quality of the audio you are listening to.</p>
<p>So these are all the steps:
1/ Can the model run faster - if so how ?
2/ Can smaller models give a decent quality as the large one ?
3/ Can I make the &ldquo;model&rdquo; sound as I want it to be - either via finetuning or through their &ldquo;one-shot learning method&rdquo; ?</p>
<p>[^1] Chrome does have a feature to read - but it takes internet access, and also is hidden somewhere in the three-dots options.
[^2] Well, to speechfy&rsquo;s credit, they have a really good feature, that let&rsquo;s you listen to any document, file format - be it pdf&rsquo;s, markdowns, txt&rsquo;s, and even scanned documents (they have a strong OCR feature), this is valuable.
[^3] It&rsquo;s such a classic gaming laptop spec - indeed, when I bought it, Dell G-Series, provided best value for money (I couldn&rsquo;t buy the Mac).</p>
