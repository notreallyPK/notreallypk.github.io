      <description>&lt;p&gt;Reading lists I&amp;rsquo;d like to maintain on the subject of hacking that I&amp;rsquo;ve found to resonate with me!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thankyou to the authors for publishing on the Internet!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;from ESR&amp;rsquo;s Jargon File:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;hacker: n.&#xA;A person who enjoys exploring the details of programmable systems and how to stretch their capabilities, as opposed to most users, who prefer to learn only the minimum necessary. &lt;br&gt;&#xA;RFC1392, the Internet Users&amp;rsquo; Glossary, usefully amplifies this as: A person who delights in having an intimate understanding of the internal workings of a system, computers and computer networks in particular.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I have been trying to figure out answers to questions as well, and it&amp;rsquo;s not straight-forward.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I feel our culture / written works around these questions, have a lot of different opinions, and mostly leave out the messy part - the empty dread of not knowing what comes next when you decide upon something. Currently, I have found the following couple of ideas that help convey what I have been thinking about:&lt;/p&gt;</description>
